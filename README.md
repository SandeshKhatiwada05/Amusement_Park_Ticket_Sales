##Ticket Booking System
A console-based ticket booking system implemented in Java. This application calculates the total ticket cost based on the number of persons and applies a discount for group bookings (more than 5 persons).

##Features
Individual Booking: Collects information for each person (name).
Group Discount: Applies a 10% discount if the group size is more than 5.
Detailed Billing: Displays a summary of ticket costs for each person and the total cost.

##How It Works
1. The user enters the number of persons.
2. For each person, their name is recorded.
3. The system calculates the total ticket cost:
    Ticket price per person: Rs. 400.0
    If the number of persons exceeds 5, a 10% discount is applied.
4. Outputs a detailed bill with the individual names, ticket prices, and the total cost.
